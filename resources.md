# 100 Days of Coding

William Ponton

This page acts as a repository for any resources, interesting articles, videos, or other links that I use or find intersting during the challenge.  I will reference the day related to the resource.

## Day 0
[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNjXL9KbN4w) refreshed my memory on how to clone a Github project using Anaconda prompt.


## Day 2
[Will R Chase's site](https://www.williamrchase.com/) is a huge inspiration for my personal portfolio site.  I love Will's site because it shows a lot of personality and has some really impressive visualizations.

[Angela Baltes](https://angelabaltes.com/) my friend from a Python bootcamp also has a killer site that I was inspired by.  I love simplicity and professionalism of her site.

## Day 3
[This article](https://gist.github.com/alexpchin/102854243cd066f8b88e) is a start to solving my problem of pushing a local project to a new Git repo from VS.

This Git [Cheat Sheet](https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet/) is a nifty cheat sheet for Git commands.

Ultimate [Git](https://gist.github.com/cferdinandi/ef665330286fd5d7127d#file-terminal-cheat-sheet-txt) cheat sheet right here.  I stumbled on this one and I think this will solve all my problems.
