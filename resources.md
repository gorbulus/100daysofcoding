# 100 Days of Coding

William Ponton

This page acts as a repository for any resources, interesting articles, videos, or other links that I use or find intersting during the challenge.  I will reference the day related to the resource.

## Day 0
[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNjXL9KbN4w) refreshed my memory on how to clone a Github project using Anaconda prompt.


## Day 2
[Will R Chase's site](https://www.williamrchase.com/) is a huge inspiration for my personal portfolio site.  I love Will's site because it shows a lot of personality and has some really impressive visualizations.

[Angela Baltes](https://angelabaltes.com/) my friend from a Python bootcamp also has a killer site that I was inspired by.  I love simplicity and professionalism of her site.
