# ⚡ 100 Days Of Code Log ⚡

###  - Round 1 -

## William Ponton

This is the log to my 100 days of code challenge.

I'm starting the challenge on 7.27.2020 and plan to finish 11.4.2020.

# Log

## Day 0: July 27, 2020

### Today's progress:
Today I started my 100 Days of Code challenge!  I setup my Anaconda environment, created the repository for the log, and made some local directories so I can push to Github.  I didn't even forget my password.  I also made files resources that I find along the way and code snippets that I find useful for this challenge.

### Thoughts:

I'm excited for the challenge and am looking forward to learning and refreshing my passion for Python and programming.

## Day 1: July 28, 2020

### Today's progress:
I worked on my portfolio site which will be a web application built in Visual Studio.  I built the site master, added folders for images and data to the project and some basic css copied from an older site.  The goal for this page is to create a place for projects, photos, recipes, and blogging.

### Thoughts:

I had trouble getting Github setup with this project because I already has a repository locally and I wasn't able to sync the work to the new repo on GH.  Will try again!

## Day 2: July 29, 2020

### Today's progress:
Worked more on the portfolio site.  Added a contact page, filled out the about section and updates some formatting.  I created a css file and also wrote some formatting.

### Thoughts:

This project is a place for me to showcase projects/dashboards, post pictures, and blog.  I was inspired by another friend whose site is amazing!  Check out in the [Resources](resources.md) file!

## Day 3: July 30, 2020

### Today's progress:
Today I kept picking at the portfolio site.  I added a page that will hold travel photos and I am thinking that some kind of parralax scrolling or svg animation would be cool to learn.  I think I found some ways to get help with syncing this VS project to Github and need to sort it out this weekend! I am going to use this [article](https://gist.github.com/alexpchin/102854243cd066f8b88e) to start.  I also found a really cool [git cheat sheet](https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet/) that will help me.  I'm ok at bash and cmd but don't know all the commands by heart.

### Thoughts:

I have build web apps which ran locally but I have never deployed so I am excited to learn that process and am a bit overwhelmed at the choices (AWS, Heroku, etc).  I am also wondering if my next project should be to make some apps with Django because I have two books I have been meaning to dig into for some time.

## Day 4: July 31, 2020

### Today's progress:
Not a ton of steam left over tonight after a big week at work, so I added some css to the personal site and played around with image formatting in the jumbotron (sizing).  Big plans to move this forward this weekend!

### Thoughts:

Although my passion is related to data analytics and numerical analysis, I need a place to house my projects and a simple site is a great way to accomplish that so the site is my top priority in this code sprint.  My plan is to have a deployed site by mid-August at the latest so I can start populating with dashboards and projects!

## Day 5: August 1, 2020

### Today's progress:
Eureka!  I finally solved the problem I was having pushing my portfolio site files to Github and synced up my local environment with a new repo.  I learned about upstream remote origins and sharpened my command line skills.  I really like Anaconda so I mainly user anacondaprompt for command line, and that's where I had success... go figure.  I found a great site that helped me linked in the [resources](resources.md)

### Thoughts:

The small victories in solving a problem is the reward with computer science.  Sometimes it's easy to get frustrated or overwhelmed by a problem that you don't understand but perserverence will crack the nut every time.

## Day 6: August 2, 2020

### Today's progress:
Today I made buttons on the home page for each of the redirected sites and added some links to the nav-bar with emojis.

### Thoughts:

Today was mostly housekeeping and checking over the organization of all the files.  I had a few errors with misspellings in the button vs the event argrument so there were a few small wins in debugging.

[Github](https://www.github.com/gorbulus/portfolio_site)

## Day 7: August 3, 2020

### Today's progress:
I updated the About page and the Contact page with some Bootstrap formatting.  I structured my text and lists in rows and used the command for medium columns.  col-md-4 gives medium columns of a width of 4/12 of the page width.  Bootstrap can be tricky - I need to remember how to add padding so I can do centering or right justification...

### Thoughts:

Remembering bootstrap was rewarding because I really struggled to learn it in my ASP.Net course.  That course was difficult because it combined HTML, CSS, C#, SQL, and some Javascript all at once so it was easy to get lost in "what's breaking!?!".  I struggled with organizing the page in columns and rows and now feel like my trauma paid off because I easily picked it back up.

## Day 8: August 4, 2020

### Today's progress
Tonight I organized some images that I am going to use on the travel, dog, and food section of the site.  I spent quite a lot of time formatting and resizing the images to add tiles to the pages.

### Thoughts:
Not a ton of coding but I didn't have much time after class tonight.

### Link to work:
[Github](https://www.github.com/gorbulus/portfolio_site)


## Day 9: August 5, 2020

### Today's progress
📬 Today I worked on my site again and updated my Contact page and added some code to populate a subject line when a user clicks "Email me".

In the hyperlink reference, add "?subject=" and then write your subject line. Use the "%20" mask for spaces because the link will break if you use the spacebar and break the string.

#### Example:
<a href="mailto:myEmail@gmail.com?subject=[Yo%20Will!]%20I%20saw%20your%20code%20and%20thought%20it%20was%20cool">💌 Email me</a>

## Day 10: August 6, 2020

### Today's progress
This evening I updated more pages on my site with 👢 Bootstrap containers and ways to organize the images and links that will be populated soon. I want to learn more about SVG and animation so I did some googling and found a cool [background generator](https://www.svgbackgrouns.com) that will come in handy! 💡

### Thoughts
I like the presets and want to tinker with a cool background and add my personal logo.  Check out the SVG background generator in the [Resources](resources.md) log.

### Link to work:
[Github](https://github.com/gorbulus/portfolio_site/)


## Day 11: August 7, 2020

### Today's progress
Tonight I added more Bootstrap to my Default page and also some css for the buttons.  I researched some hosting sites and looked up domains to see what my options would be.  I think it's down to GoDaddy or Bluehost but I need to do more research.

### Thoughts
I plan to deploy the site soon, hopefully this week.  Next steps are adding images and a possibly a database for holding user logins?

### Link to work:
[Github](https://github.com/gorbulus/portfolio_site/)

## Day 12: August 8, 2020

### Today's progress
Today I worked on the image grid system for the pages that will hold images on my site. I have a ton of cropping and resizing to do to align my vision of the pages and the reality of the images I want displayed. Also researched parralax scrolling and some more modern design styles which I will incorporate as well. Can't believe how much I've done in just 12 days and I am still loving this challenge!

### Thoughts
Still amped up about the 100 Days of Coding challengs and I'm so excited for what's next after I finish the site!  The next step will be to fill up the project site with some basic projects that I've completed and add in a few that I have in mind for the 100 Days Challenge that will be new.

## Day 13: August 9, 2020

### Today's progress
Tonight I organized the Projects page on my portfolio site and added and image grid and links to some of my favorite projects.  I linked to the Wine Review Analysis, Slot Machine, and PyPass Gen password generator.  I played with the svg background generator but didn't get the one I liked to work - will try again.

### Thoughts
I want to have links to Github code and actual deployed apps from this projects page where a users can choose between "Code" or "App" and use the tools I build.  I also would like to add a dropdown list for various coding languages and technologies in each project and allow the user to filter.

## Day 14: August 10, 2020

### Today's progress
This is finals week for Summer term so I focused on studying for those exams tonight.  I read a few articles on Medium and added some [resources](resources.md) for after my final tomorrow!

### Thoughts
I'm eager for the Summer term to be over so I can dedicate more time to my coding projects.  Doing this challenge has resparked my love of problem solving and using my creativity and technological skills together.

### Link to work:
[Github](https://github.com/gorbulus/portfolio_site/)


## Day 15: August 11, 2020

### Today's progress
Tonight after class I added a dropdown list to the projects page so users can browse projects with different technologies.  I want to showcase a holistic view of my skills from SQL to C++, Python and Data Analysis.

### Thoughts
Need to get this site deployed and figure out how to link my working projects to the project page!  Shouldn't be too hard but I don't have too much extra free time during finals week.

### Link to work:
[Github](https://github.com/gorbulus/portfolio_site/)


## Day 16: August 12, 2020

### Today's progress
📝 Tonight I added three pages to my site project that are linked through the travel page.  Each page will hold some favorite pics from some of my favorite places.  I also added links through the image placeholders so clicking the pic will redirect the user.  🔀

### Thoughts
I'm getting better at this each day although I'm just doing some easy HTML and Bootstrap stuff right now.  I will be excited to get this site posted and then will shift my focus to some dashboards and R projects I have in mind!

### Link to work:
[Github](https://github.com/gorbulus/portfolio_site/travel)


## Day 17: August 13, 2020

### Today's progress
📝 Today I updated the Food page with and image grid and added some additional pages for recipes.  I want to use this space for a database hookup for sharing our favorite recipes.  Photos too of course!  🔀

### Thoughts
We love to cook and during Quarantine we tried so many new recipes and copycate dishes from our favorite restaurants.  When we craved something like enchiladas, we did some research and tried to perfect our techniques.

### Link to work:
[Github](https://github.com/gorbulus/portfolio_site/)


## Day 18: August 14, 2020

### Today's progress
Updated the Dogs page - same updates as the other pages, added image grid, placeholder images and some formatting.  This weekend I will add the images to the pages and scale the site.  Plan to deploy this upcoming week!

### Thoughts
Finals are over and it's time to wrap up this website mini-project and  get to some real coding.

[Github](https://github.com/gorbulus/portfolio_site/)


## Day 19: August 15, 2020

### Today's progress
Tonight I worked on cropping and formatting tons of photos for my site.  I researched ways to have mutiple sized photos fit within the Bootstrap framework.  I want to have parallax scrolling and svg animation so I am looking at how to include those features as well. 🐦

### Thoughts
I want my site to have a modern and creative design.  Part of what I love about coding is the creativity and freedom to build things in your own way.

[Github](https://github.com/gorbulus/portfolio_site/)

## Day 20: August 16, 2020

### Today's progress
Updated all the pages to make sure I have comments and everything is standardized.  Worked on a second 'footer' jumbotron with an image of Irazu!  I cleaned up some images that weren't links as well.

### Thoughts
Ready to add pictures and deploy soon!

[Github](https://github.com/gorbulus/portfolio_site/)


## Day 21: August 17, 2020

### Today's progress
Day 21 of 100 days of code! I'm still working on the website but I have learned a ton about Bootstrap and and responsive web design.

### Thoughts
This challenge is going well and I can't wait to deploy the site and add connect some of my other projects.  I thing Django would be a very useful tool to use so I want to somehow include Django in my next web app.

## Day 22: August 18, 2020

### Today's progress
Massive progress this evening!  I added the pictures to the image grid on two of the travel pages.  I have the images organized and displayed and need to continue to work on the css to achieve the effect that I am looking for.

### Thoughts
Big progress today, very happy!

## Day 24: August 20, 2020

### Today's progress
Updates made to the Food pages and I kept on debugging the nav bar issue (it's driving me crazy!).

### Thoughts
I have some friends at work that might be able to help me solve the navbar issue I'm having, yet I want to fix this one myself.  I'm only going to use them as a last resort!

### Link to work:
[Github](https://github.com/gorbulus/portfolio_site/)


## Day 25: August 21, 2020

### Today's progress
Tonight I added pictures to the travel pages and continued to work on the organization and formatting of the image grid.  Still haven't solved the navbar error I have, feel confident that I can fix it this weekend.

### Thoughts
Classes are over and now I have some real time to sink into the coding projects I have planned!

### Link to work:
[Github](https://github.com/gorbulus/portfolio_site/)


## Day 26: August 22, 2020

### Today's progress
Progress today on the projects page.  I organized the various projects into 'cards' with an image and description using Bootstrap.

### Thoughts
Still haven't figured out my nav bar issue, I'm thinking of starting an entire new project and copying over the working code.

### Link to work:
[Github](https://github.com/gorbulus/portfolio_site/)


## Day 27: August 23, 2020

### Today's progress
This afternoon I worked on updating images on the travel page.  I also progressed in troubleshooting the navbar issue I am having and I feel that I am very close to solving it!

### Thoughts
Not much work on the site this week, but I am really ready to solve my navbar issue and move on to something else.

### Link to work:
[Github](https://github.com/gorbulus/portfolio_site/)

## Day 28: August 24, 2020

### Today's progress
Today I continued to work on the formatting of the image grids for my travel pages.  I organized the images into columns and made the width on the images responsive.

### Thoughts
More image work and some work on INE, my Python courses.

## Day 29: August 25, 2020

### Today's progress
Tonight's progress continued on my INE coursework.  The project at the end of the first module is related to nested dictionaries and turninig a list of data into a structured object/data type.

### Thoughts
I needed the refresher on some of the more esoteric corners of Python.  When I took the RMOTR bootcamp in 2019 I learned so much and there's certainly some topics that I didn't dive deeeply into so I am glad to retake some of the new RMOTR modules via the INE platform.

### Thoughts
I was having some trouble with understanding the exercise for the second problem.  Part of being a good problem solver is being able to decipher what's the cause and to see how the pieces fit together to resolve the task.

## Day 32: August 28, 2020

### Today's progress
Tonight's progress continued on my INE coursework.  In the dataset, the various football players are structured as a "list of lists".  Each team is a list of players, and each player is also represented as a list with information about the player.  This type of data structure is very common in the real world  - invoices and customers.

### Thoughts
I really love the challenging assignments in the RMOTR coursework (INE now).  Sanitago and his team really made engaging activities that keep your brain moving.

## Day 33: August 29, 2020

### Today's progress
The first portion of the football dictionary project is rather simple, turn the provided squad data into a dictionary.  From there you can easily call the records in the dict that hold the team and player data.  The second assignment is to group the players into lists by position.  A bit more tricky.

### Thoughts
Python is strange sometimes, especially coming from typesafe languages like the C family.

## Day 34: August 30, 2020

### Today's progress
Worked on part three of the assignment tonight - almost finished!  The final part of the exercise is to add one more layer of nesting and group the players by country and then position.

### Thoughts
THis reminds me of linked lists when I learned C, so although the concept can be tough to conceptualize, the overall idea makes perfect sense when you understand.  Another example is the volume of revolutionary solids from Calc II. *shudders*

## Day 36: September 1, 2020

### Today's progress
This evening I worked on some SQL queries, a short reprieve from the Python and HTML stuff I have been doing.  I think SQL is super useful and I have a big project in the works that will really benefit from some focused queries, so I wanted to practice my skills.  I linked a few tables together and used some aggregate functions.

### Thoughts
I want to check out MongoDB and PostgreSQL for some Python projects that will need a database.  I want to make a three-layer Django app with a data layer.

## Day 38: September 3, 2020

### Today's progress
Tonight I worked on a new notebook for my DS playbook.  I want to start a series of common functions and cleanup methods to have on hand.

### Thoughts
I need to explore Github's 'gists', which are code snippets you can save in your user profile.  These could be very useful for helping me remember some common themes and also help others who check out my profile.

## Day 42: September 7, 2020

### Today's progress
This evening I worked on my DS Playbook, adding a page for Matplotlib examples and reference.  I  used some examples from the documentation and a book that I have, so this was a fun notebook to work on.

### Thoughts
People sometimes overlook Matplotlib for fancier libraries - I really like this tool and the host of cool features that I found in the documentation that I have never used before!
It would be fun to run through every example in the gallery and do a tutorial for each.

## Day 43: September 8, 2020

### Today's progress
I worked more on my Matplotlib notebook and added references for simple bar and line charts, scatter plots, and histograms.  I think this week will be spent adding some other cool visualizations from Matplotlib and planning the next notebook.

### Thoughts
I really had fun coding some simple charts and want to improve my memorization of basic commands and attributes of the common charts.  Adding labels, titles, and making the data tell a story is one of the most important parts of Data Science.

## Day 49: September 15, 2020

### Today's progress
Tonight I made some charts using data from some of my favorite bands - the rocker dataset.  I believe that throughout the years of talent and musical trends there seems to be a fluctuation in the member count of the artists.  I think that there will be a correlation in member count compared to 5 year segments of time.  It would be interesting to look at this with a wider lense and analyze musical collectives across history.  In the scope of human musical accomplishment, more people were needed to create music in the past due to acoustics and the available technology and skill.

### Thoughts
This could be due to certain genres and instruments coming into fashion, or some kind of economic indicator of GDP (more money for and programs for people to learn music).  I also believe that art is a result of prosperity - it's well documented that the earliest peoples developed story-telling and music only after they had developed a lifestyle that allowed time for tasks other than pure survival.  Therefore, I say that we will find some correlation between the number of band members in each band related to 5 year segments of time.
