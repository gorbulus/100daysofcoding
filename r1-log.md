## Day 0: July 27, 2020

### Today's progress:
Today I started my 100 Days of Code challenge!  I setup my Anaconda environment, created the repository for the log, and made some local directories so I can push to Github.  I didn't even forget my password.  I also made files resources that I find along the way and code snippets that I find useful for this challenge.

### Thoughts:

I'm excited for the challenge and am looking forward to learning and refreshing my passion for Python and programming.
