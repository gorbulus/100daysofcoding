# Log

## Day 0: July 27, 2020

### Today's progress:
Today I started my 100 Days of Code challenge!  I setup my Anaconda environment, created the repository for the log, and made some local directories so I can push to Github.  I didn't even forget my password.  I also made files resources that I find along the way and code snippets that I find useful for this challenge.

### Thoughts:

I'm excited for the challenge and am looking forward to learning and refreshing my passion for Python and programming.

## Day 1: July 28, 2020

### Today's progress:
I worked on my portfolio site which will be a web application built in Visual Studio.  I built the site master, added folders for images and data to the project and some basic css copied from an older site.  The goal for this page is to create a place for projects, photos, recipes, and blogging.

### Thoughts:

I had trouble getting Github setup with this project because I already has a repository locally and I wasn't able to sync the work to the new repo on GH.  Will try again!

## Day 2: July 29, 2020

### Today's progress:
Worked more on the portfolio site.  Added a contact page, filled out the about section and updates some formatting.  I created a css file and also wrote some formatting.

### Thoughts:

This project is a place for me to showcase projects/dashboards, post pictures, and blog.  I was inspired by another friend whose site is amazing!  Check out in the [Resources](resources.md) file!

## Day 3: July 30, 2020

### Today's progress:
Today I kept picking at the portfolio site.  I added a page that will hold travel photos and I am thinking that some kind of parralax scrolling or svg animation would be cool to learn.  I think I found some ways to get help with syncing this VS project to Github and need to sort it out this weekend! I am going to use this [article](https://gist.github.com/alexpchin/102854243cd066f8b88e) to start.  I also found a really cool [git cheat sheet](https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet/) that will help me.  I'm ok at bash and cmd but don't know all the commands by heart.

### Thoughts:

I have build web apps which ran locally but I have never deployed so I am excited to learn that process and am a bit overwhelmed at the choices (AWS, Heroku, etc).  I am also wondering if my next project should be to make some apps with Django because I have two books I have been meaning to dig into for some time.

## Day 4: July 31, 2020

### Today's progress:
Not a ton of steam left over tonight after a big week at work, so I added some css to the personal site and played around with image formatting in the jumbotron (sizing).  Big plans to move this forward this weekend!

### Thoughts:

Although my passion is related to data analytics and numerical analysis, I need a place to house my projects and a simple site is a great way to accomplish that so the site is my top priority in this code sprint.  My plan is to have a deployed site by mid-August at the latest so I can start populating with dashboards and projects!

## Day 5: August 1, 2020

### Today's progress:
Eureka!  I finally solved the problem I was having pushing my portfolio site files to Github and synced up my local environment with a new repo.  I learned about upstream remote origins and sharpened my command line skills.  I really like Anaconda so I mainly user anacondaprompt for command line, and that's where I had success... go figure.  I found a great site that helped me linked in the [resources](resources.md)

### Thoughts:

The small victories in solving a problem is the reward with computer science.  Sometimes it's easy to get frustrated or overwhelmed by a problem that you don't understand but perserverence will crack the nut every time.

## Day 6: August 2, 2020

### Today's progress:
Today I made buttons on the home page for each of the redirected sites and added some links to the nav-bar with emojis.

### Thoughts:

Today was mostly housekeeping and checking over the organization of all the files.  I had a few errors with misspellings in the button vs the event argrument so there were a few small wins in debugging.

## Day 7: August 3, 2020

### Today's progress:
I updated the About page and the Contact page with some Bootstrap formatting.  I structured my text and lists in rows and used the command for medium columns.  col-md-4 gives medium columns of a width of 4/12 of the page width.  Bootstrap can be tricky - I need to remember how to add padding so I can do centering or right justification...

### Thoughts:

Remembering bootstrap was rewarding because I really struggled to learn it in my ASP.Net course.  That course was difficult because it combined HTML, CSS, C#, SQL, and some Javascript all at once so it was easy to get lost in "what's breaking!?!".  I struggled with organizing the page in columns and rows and now feel like my trauma paid off because I easily picked it back up.

## Day 8: August 4, 2020

### Today's progress
Tonight I organized some images that I am going to use on the travel, dog, and food section of the site.  I spent quite a lot of time formatting and resizing the images to add tiles to the pages.

### Thoughts:
Not a ton of coding but I didn't have much time after class tonight.

## Day 9: August 5, 2020

### Today's progress
📬 Today I worked on my site again and updated my Contact page and added some code to populate a subject line when a user clicks "Email me".

In the hyperlink reference, add "?subject=" and then write your subject line. Use the "%20" mask for spaces because the link will break if you use the spacebar and break the string.

#### Example:
<a href="mailto:myEmail@gmail.com?subject=[Yo%20Will!]%20I%20saw%20your%20code%20and%20thought%20it%20was%20cool">💌 Email me</a>

## Day 10: August 6, 2020

### Today's progress
This evening I updated more pages on my site with 👢 Bootstrap containers and ways to organize the images and links that will be populated soon. I want to learn more about SVG and animation so I did some googling and found a cool [background generator](https://www.svgbackgrouns.com) that will come in handy! 💡

### Thoughts
I like the presets and want to tinker with a cool background and add my personal logo.  Check out the SVG background generator in the [Resources](resources.md) log.

## Day 11: August 7, 2020

### Today's progress
Tonight I added more Bootstrap to my Default page and also some css for the buttons.  I researched some hosting sites and looked up domains to see what my options would be.  I think it's down to GoDaddy or Bluehost but I need to do more research.

### Thoughts
I plan to deploy the site soon, hopefully this week.  Next steps are adding images and a possibly a database for holding user logins?

## Day 12: August 8, 2020

### Today's progress
Today I worked on the image grid system for the pages that will hold images on my site. I have a ton of cropping and resizing to do to align my vision of the pages and the reality of the images I want displayed. Also researched parralax scrolling and some more modern design styles which I will incorporate as well. Can't believe how much I've done in just 12 days and I am still loving this challenge!

### Thoughts
Still amped up about the 100 Days of Coding challengs and I'm so excited for what's next after I finish the site!  The next step will be to fill up the project site with some basic projects that I've completed and add in a few that I have in mind for the 100 Days Challenge that will be new.

## Day 13: August 9, 2020

### Today's progress
Tonight I organized the Projects page on my portfolio site and added and image grid and links to some of my favorite projects.  I linked to the Wine Review Analysis, Slot Machine, and PyPass Gen password generator.  I played with the svg background generator but didn't get the one I liked to work - will try again.

### Thoughts
I want to have links to Github code and actual deployed apps from this projects page where a users can choose between "Code" or "App" and use the tools I build.  I also would like to add a dropdown list for various coding languages and technologies in each project and allow the user to filter.

## Day 14: August 10, 2020

### Today's progress
This is finals week for Summer term so I focused on studying for those exams tonight.  I read a few articles on Medium and added some [resources](resources.md) for after my final tomorrow!

### Thoughts
I'm eager for the Summer term to be over so I can dedicate more time to my coding projects.  Doing this challenge has resparked my love of problem solving and using my creativity and technological skills together.

## Day 15: August 11, 2020

### Today's progress
Tonight after class I added a dropdown list to the projects page so users can browse projects with different technologies.  I want to showcase a holistic view of my skills from SQL to C++, Python and Data Analysis.

### Thoughts
Need to get this site deployed and figure out how to link my working projects to the project page!  Shouldn't be too hard but I don't have too much extra free time during finals week.

## Day 16: August 12, 2020

### Today's progress
📝 Tonight I added three pages to my site project that are linked through the travel page.  Each page will hold some favorite pics from some of my favorite places.  I also added links through the image placeholders so clicking the pic will redirect the user.  🔀

### Thoughts
I'm getting better at this each day although I'm just doing some easy HTML and Bootstrap stuff right now.  I will be excited to get this site posted and then will shift my focus to some dashboards and R projects I have in mind!
