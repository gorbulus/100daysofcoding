This is the log to my 100 days of code challenge.

I'm starting the challenge on 7.27.2020 and plan to finish 11.4.2020.

# Log

## Day 0: July 27, 2020

### Today's progress:
Today I started my 100 Days of Code challenge!  I setup my Anaconda environment, created the repository for the log, and made some local directories so I can push to Github.  I didn't even forget my password.  I also made files resources that I find along the way and code snippets that I find useful for this challenge.

### Thoughts:

I'm excited for the challenge and am looking forward to learning and refreshing my passion for Python and programming.

## Day 1: July 28, 2020

### Today's progress:
I worked on my portfolio site which will be a web application built in Visual Studio.  I built the site master, added folders for images and data to the project and some basic css copied from an older site.  The goal for this page is to create a place for projects, photos, recipes, and blogging.

### Thoughts:

I had trouble getting Github setup with this project because I already has a repository locally and I wasn't able to sync the work to the new repo on GH.  Will try again!

## Day 2: July 29, 2020

### Today's progress:
Worked more on the portfolio site.  Added a contact page, filled out the about section and updates some formatting.  I created a css file and also wrote some formatting.

### Thoughts:

This project is a place for me to showcase projects/dashboards, post pictures, and blog.  I was inspired by another friend whose site is amazing!  Check out in the [Resources](resources.md) file!

## Day 3: July 30, 2020

### Today's progress:
Today I kept picking at the portfolio site.  I added a page that will hold travel photos and I am thinking that some kind of parralax scrolling or svg animation would be cool to learn.  I think I found some ways to get help with syncing this VS project to Github and need to sort it out this weekend! I am going to use this [article](https://gist.github.com/alexpchin/102854243cd066f8b88e) to start.  I also found a really cool [git cheat sheet](https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet/) that will help me.  I'm ok at bash and cmd but don't know all the commands by heart.

### Thoughts:

I have build web apps which ran locally but I have never deployed so I am excited to learn that process and am a bit overwhelmed at the choices (AWS, Heroku, etc).  I am also wondering if my next project should be to make some apps with Django because I have two books I have been meaning to dig into for some time.

## Day 4: July 31, 2020

### Today's progress:
Not a ton of steam left over tonight after a big week at work, so I added some css to the personal site and played around with image formatting in the jumbotron (sizing).  Big plans to move this forward this weekend!

### Thoughts:

Although my passion is related to data analytics and numerical analysis, I need a place to house my projects and a simple site is a great way to accomplish that so the site is my top priority in this code sprint.  My plan is to have a deployed site by mid-August at the latest so I can start populating with dashboards and projects!

## Day 5: August 1, 2020

### Today's progress:
Eureka!  I finally solved the problem I was having pushing my portfolio site files to Github and synced up my local environment with a new repo.  I learned about upstream remote origins and sharpened my command line skills.  I really like Anaconda so I mainly user anacondaprompt for command line, and that's where I had success... go figure.  I found a great site that helped me linked in the [resources](resources.md)

### Thoughts:

The small victories in solving a problem is the reward with computer science.  Sometimes it's easy to get frustrated or overwhelmed by a problem that you don't understand but perserverence will crack the nut every time.

## Day 6: August 2, 2020

### Today's progress:
Today I made buttons on the home page for each of the redirected sites and added some links to the nav-bar with emojis.

### Thoughts:

Today was mostly housekeeping and checking over the organization of all the files.  I had a few errors with misspellings in the button vs the event argrument so there were a few small wins in debugging.

## Day 7: August 3, 2020

### Today's progress:
I updated the About page and the Contact page with some Bootstrap formatting.  I structured my text and lists in rows and used the command for medium columns.  col-md-4 gives medium columns of a width of 4/12 of the page width.  Bootstrap can be tricky - I need to remember how to add padding so I can do centering or right justification...

### Thoughts:

Remembering bootstrap was rewarding because I really struggled to learn it in my ASP.Net course.  That course was difficult because it combined HTML, CSS, C#, SQL, and some Javascript all at once so it was easy to get lost in "what's breaking!?!".  I struggled with organizing the page in columns and rows and now feel like my trauma paid off because I easily picked it back up.

## Day 8: August 4, 2020

### Today's progress
Tonight I organized some images that I am going to use on the travel, dog, and food section of the site.  I spent quite a lot of time formatting and resizing the images to add tiles to the pages.

### Thoughts:
Not a ton of coding but I didn't have much time after class tonight.

## Day 9: August 5, 2020

### Today's progress
ðŸ“¬ Today I worked on my site again and updated my Contact page and added some code to populate a subject line when a user clicks "Email me".

In the hyperlink reference, add "?subject=" and then write your subject line. Use the "%20" mask for spaces because the link will break if you use the spacebar and break the string.

#### Example:
<a href="mailto:myEmail@gmail.com?subject=[Yo%20Will!]%20I%20saw%20your%20code%20and%20thought%20it%20was%20cool">ðŸ’Œ Email me</a>

## Day 10: August 6, 2020

### Today's progress
This evening I updated more pages on my site with ðŸ‘¢ Bootstrap containers and ways to organize the images and links that will be populated soon. I want to learn more about SVG and animation so I did some googling and found a cool [background generator](https://www.svgbackgrouns.com) that will come in handy! ðŸ’¡

### Thoughts
I like the presets and want to tinker with a cool background and add my personal logo.  Check out the SVG background generator in the [Resources](resources.md) log.

## Day 11: August 7, 2020

### Today's progress
Tonight I added more Bootstrap to my Default page and also some css for the buttons.  I researched some hosting sites and looked up domains to see what my options would be.  I think it's down to GoDaddy or Bluehost but I need to do more research.

### Thoughts
I plan to deploy the site soon, hopefully this week.  Next steps are adding images and a possibly a database for holding user logins?
