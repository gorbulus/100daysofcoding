## Day 0: July 27, 2020

### Today's progress:
Today I started my 100 Days of Code challenge!  I setup my Anaconda environment, created the repository for the log, and made some local directories so I can push to Github.  I didn't even forget my password.  I also made files resources that I find along the way and code snippets that I find useful for this challenge.

### Thoughts:

I'm excited for the challenge and am looking forward to learning and refreshing my passion for Python and programming.

## Day 1: July 28, 2020

### Today's progress:
I worked on my portfolio site which will be a web application built in Visual Studio.  I built the site master, added folders for images and data to the project and some basic css copied from an older site.  The goal for this page is to create a place for projects, photos, recipes, and blogging.

### Thoughts:

I had trouble getting Github setup with this project because I already has a repository locally and I wasn't able to sync the work to the new repo on GH.  Will try again!

### Link to work:
None yet, working on a public link to the project.
