# Log

## Day 0: July 27, 2020

### Today's progress:
Today I started my 100 Days of Code challenge!  I setup my Anaconda environment, created the repository for the log, and made some local directories so I can push to Github.  I didn't even forget my password.  I also made files resources that I find along the way and code snippets that I find useful for this challenge.

### Thoughts:

I'm excited for the challenge and am looking forward to learning and refreshing my passion for Python and programming.

## Day 1: July 28, 2020

### Today's progress:
I worked on my portfolio site which will be a web application built in Visual Studio.  I built the site master, added folders for images and data to the project and some basic css copied from an older site.  The goal for this page is to create a place for projects, photos, recipes, and blogging.

### Thoughts:

I had trouble getting Github setup with this project because I already has a repository locally and I wasn't able to sync the work to the new repo on GH.  Will try again!

## Day 2: July 29, 2020

### Today's progress:
Worked more on the portfolio site.  Added a contact page, filled out the about section and updates some formatting.  I created a css file and also wrote some formatting.

### Thoughts:

This project is a place for me to showcase projects/dashboards, post pictures, and blog.  I was inspired by another friend whose site is amazing!  Check out in the [Resources](resources.md) file!

## Day 3: July 30, 2020

### Today's progress:
Today I kept picking at the portfolio site.  I added a page that will hold travel photos and I am thinking that some kind of parralax scrolling or svg animation would be cool to learn.  I think I found some ways to get help with syncing this VS project to Github and need to sort it out this weekend! I am going to use this [article](https://gist.github.com/alexpchin/102854243cd066f8b88e) to start.  I also found a really cool [git cheat sheet](https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet/) that will help me.  I'm ok at bash and cmd but don't know all the commands by heart.

### Thoughts:

I have build web apps which ran locally but I have never deployed so I am excited to learn that process and am a bit overwhelmed at the choices (AWS, Heroku, etc).  I am also wondering if my next project should be to make some apps with Django because I have two books I have been meaning to dig into for some time.

## Day 4: July 31, 2020

### Today's progress:
Not a ton of steam left over tonight after a big week at work, so I added some css to the personal site and played around with image formatting in the jumbotron (sizing).  Big plans to move this forward this weekend!

### Thoughts:

Although my passion is realted to data analytics and numerical analysis, I need a place to house my projects and a simple site is a great way to accomplish that, so the site is my top priority in this code sprint.  My plans is to have a deployed site by mid-August at the latest so I can start populating with dashboards and projects!
